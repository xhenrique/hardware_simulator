# hardware_simulator

All files named "something-something.txt" are KML routes extracted from google maps and converted into GPS GPGAA coordinates.
These coordinates are used to simulate a car moving over a road inside a city or anywhere.
Based on the sent frequency, we can have a very smooth and cool moviment for the simulation. Some mathematical work can be done do create a even smoothier movement.

hwSimulator.py is the main file. The code reflects my abilities almost 5 years from the day i'm writing this(that is september 28, 2022).

Hope you laugh as i did when i read it today. We can see the extreme go horse on his best.

Thanks for reading and gl understanding anything here.
